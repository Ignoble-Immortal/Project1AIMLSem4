Indian weddings are notoriously elaborate affairs, requiring a multitude of outfit changes for multiple days of festivities.

It used to be normal for a family visiting Brij Kishore Agarwal’s sari shop, near the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk market in India’s Old Delhi, to depart with a big bundle of bright, embroidered garments and leave behind a substantial pile of cash.

Worries that someone would break in and steal the money before he could make a bank deposit kept the store’s now-79-year-old owner awake at night.

These days he sleeps easier, because almost all his customers use e-payments to complete their purchases.

“I have seen this country change,” says Agarwal, who has worked in the shop for about 65 years. “We very rarely get cash payments.”

Digital payments, made through systems like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which allow users to transfer funds instantly by scanning a QR code, have become ubiquitous across the world’s most populous country, transforming daily life.

In Delhi, tea sellers collect rupees via mobile apps, and tuk tuk drivers who pull over to buy parathas stuffed with steaming hot paneer pay with their phones.

The e-payment revolution is also likely to play an important role in India’s attempts to become an economic superpower. It is the planet’s fifth biggest economy, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently running for his third consecutive term, has said he wants India to be considered “developed” by 2047.

“Digital payments are likely to enhance India’s growth by eliminating frictions, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs,” Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, told CNN. “UPI and the broader digitization of the economy could also increase the inclusiveness of this growth,” he added.
