      "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\n",

       "[{'story': \"It 's official : U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria .\\n\\nObama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night , hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons .\\n\\nThe proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force `` to deter , disrupt , prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction . ''\\n\\nIt 's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle .\\n\\nThere are key questions looming over the debate : What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria ? What happens if Congress votes no ? And how will the Syrian government react ?\\n\\nIn a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday , the president said he would take his case to Congress , not because he has to -- but because he wants to .\\n\\n`` While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , '' he said . `` We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual . ''\\n\\nObama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9 . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday , Sen. Robert Menendez said .\\n\\nTranscript : Read Obama 's full remarks\\n\\nSyrian crisis : Latest developments\\n\\nU.N. inspectors leave Syria\\n\\nObama 's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria , carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb .\\n\\n`` The aim of the game here , the mandate , is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom , '' U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday .\\n\\nBut who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis .\\n\\nTop U.S. officials have said there 's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it , while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels .\\n\\nBritish and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons , but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors .\\n\\nThe inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban , who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team 's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council .\\n\\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , which nine of the inspectors belong to , said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected .\\n\\n`` It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples , '' Nesirky said .\\n\\nHe noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria , and that `` a military solution is not an option . ''\\n\\nBergen : Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S.\\n\\nObama : ` This menace must be confronted '\\n\\nObama 's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take , and the president 's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria . Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire .\\n\\nSome global leaders have expressed support , but the British Parliament 's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama 's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies .\\n\\nOn Saturday , Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces , he said .\\n\\nSyria 's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month `` is an assault on human dignity , '' the president said .\\n\\nA failure to respond with force , Obama argued , `` could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm . In a world with many dangers , this menace must be confronted . ''\\n\\nSyria missile strike : What would happen next ?\\n\\nMap : U.S. and allied assets around Syria\\n\\nObama decision came Friday night\\n\\nOn Friday night , the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers .\\n\\nWhat will happen if they vote no ?\\n\\nIt 's unclear . A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force .\\n\\nObama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government .\\n\\nHe spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech .\\n\\n`` The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world , '' the White House said .\\n\\nMeanwhile , as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in , U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready .\\n\\n5 key assertions : U.S. intelligence report on Syria\\n\\nSyria : Who wants what after chemical weapons horror\\n\\nReactions mixed to Obama 's speech\\n\\nA spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama 's announcement .\\n\\n`` Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way , '' said spokesman Louay Safi . `` So we are quite concerned . ''\\n\\nSome members of Congress applauded Obama 's decision .\\n\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president .\\n\\n`` Under the Constitution , the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress , '' the Republican lawmakers said . `` We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious , substantive questions being raised . ''\\n\\nMore than 160 legislators , including 63 of Obama 's fellow Democrats , had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a `` full debate '' before any U.S. action .\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron , whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week , responded to Obama 's speech in a Twitter post Saturday .\\n\\n`` I understand and support Barack Obama 's position on Syria , '' Cameron said .\\n\\nAn influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory .\\n\\n`` The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress : the military operation did not get enough support either in the world , among allies of the US or in the United States itself , '' Alexei Pushkov , chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma , said in a Twitter post .\\n\\nIn the United States , scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday .\\n\\n`` Like many other Americans ... we 're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries , '' said Robin Rosecrans , who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration .\\n\\nWhat do Syria 's neighbors think ?\\n\\nWhy Russia , China , Iran stand by Assad\\n\\nSyria 's government unfazed\\n\\nAfter Obama 's speech , a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is `` embarrassed '' that Russia opposes military action against Syria , is `` crying for help '' for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels .\\n\\nSyria 's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling .\\n\\n`` The Syrian Army 's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges , '' Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy , according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama 's address .\\n\\nAn anchor on Syrian state television said Obama `` appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies . ''\\n\\nA top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel , Turkey , some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States .\\n\\n`` I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament , '' said Bashar Jaafari , Syria 's ambassador to the United Nations .\\n\\nBoth Obama and Cameron , he said , `` climbed to the top of the tree and do n't know how to get down . ''\\n\\nThe Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack , saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it .\\n\\nBritish intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350 .\\n\\nOn Saturday , Obama said `` all told , well over 1,000 people were murdered . '' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429 , more than 400 of them children . No explanation was offered for the discrepancy .\\n\\nIran : U.S. military action in Syria would spark ` disaster '\\n\\nOpinion : Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea\\n\\n\",\n",

       " {'story': \"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Usain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men 's 4x100m relay .\\n\\nThe fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter , Kemar Bailey-Cole , Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds .\\n\\nThe U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover .\\n\\nThe 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships , equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis , Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix , not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles .\\n\\nThe relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital .\\n\\n`` I 'm proud of myself and I 'll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible , '' Bolt said , having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics .\\n\\nVictory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade , while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems .\\n\\nGatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt .\\n\\nEarlier , Jamaica 's women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold , anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce , who like Bolt was completing a triple .\\n\\nTheir quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds , well clear of France , who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds .\\n\\nDefending champions , the United States , were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner , but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover .\\n\\nThe British quartet , who were initially fourth , were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men 's team .\\n\\nFraser-Pryce , like Bolt aged 26 , became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay .\\n\\nIn other final action on the last day of the championships , France 's Teddy Tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump , exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold .\\n\\nGermany 's Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women 's javelin after five previous silvers , while Kenya 's Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men 's 1500m final .\\n\\nKiprop 's compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum was a surprise winner of the women 's 800m .\\n\\nBolt 's final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale , but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium .\\n\\nThere was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist Yelena Isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of Russia 's new laws , which make `` the propagandizing of non-traditional sexual relations among minors '' a criminal offense .\\n\\nShe later attempted to clarify her comments , but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi , the next major sports event in Russia .\\n\\n\",\n",
